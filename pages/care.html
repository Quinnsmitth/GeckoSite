      <h2>Introduction to Crested Geckos</h2>
      <img src="../images/IntroGecko.jpg" alt="Crested Gecko">
      <p>
        Crested geckos (Correlophus ciliatus) are arboreal lizards native to the humid rainforests of New Caledonia.
        Once believed to be extinct until their rediscovery in 1994, they quickly became one of the most popular pet reptiles due to their gentle temperament and low-maintenance care requirements.
        Cresties do not require complicated heating, can thrive in room-temperature environments, and do not need live insects as a primary food source, making them ideal for both beginners and experienced keepers.
        They are known for the “eyelash-like” crests above their eyes, sticky toe pads for climbing, and their ability to drop their tail (which does not grow back).
        With proper care, a crested gecko can live 15–20 years in captivity.

      <h2>Bioactive vs Non-Bioactive Enclosures</h2>
      <img src="../images/bio1.jpg" alt="Bioactive enclosure">
      <p>
         A bioactive enclosure is a self-sustaining ecosystem designed to mimic a natural rainforest floor.
         It typically includes live plants, natural substrate layers (drainage, soil, leaf litter), and a clean-up crew of springtails and isopods that help break down waste and prevent mold.
         This type of setup provides mental stimulation, higher humidity stability, and a visually appealing display.
         A non-bioactive enclosure, on the other hand, uses substrates like paper towels, reptile carpet, or coconut fiber that must be cleaned or replaced regularly.
         These setups require less initial work, allow easier monitoring of waste and hydration levels, and are often recommended for new keepers who want a simple maintenance routine.
         Both enclosure types are safe and healthy as long as they are kept clean and allow the gecko to hide, climb, and thermoregulate.
         Your choice ultimately depends on how much upkeep you prefer and whether you enjoy naturalistic enclosures.

      <h2>Feeding & Nutrition</h2>
      <img src="../images/geckoEat.webp" alt="Crested gecko eating">
      <p>
         Crested geckos thrive on a diet centered around a complete powdered food mix known as CGD (Crested Gecko Diet).
         This diet contains balanced vitamins, minerals, and proteins specifically formulated for their needs, and should be offered 3–4 times per week.
         Fresh CGD should be mixed with water to a yogurt-like consistency and replaced every 24 hours.
         While CGD can be the sole diet, many keepers supplement with insects like crickets or dubia roaches once or twice per week.
         Insects should be appropriately sized (no larger than the space between the gecko’s eyes) and gut-loaded for added nutrition.
         Always dust insects with a calcium + D3 supplement to prevent metabolic bone disease.
         Treats like mashed fruit can be offered sparingly, but should never replace the main diet.
         Clean water should always be available in a shallow dish even though most cresties prefer to drink droplets after misting.

      <h2>Humidity, Lighting, and Temperature</h2>
      <img src="../images/guide.webp" alt="Enclosure environment">
        <p>
         Proper environmental conditions are essential for keeping a crested gecko healthy.
         Humidity should be maintained between 50–70%, with a nightly rise caused by misting the enclosure.
         This allows for proper shedding, hydration, and overall comfort.
         Good ventilation is equally important, as stagnant overly wet air can lead to respiratory issues.
         Crested geckos are comfortable at typical household temperatures, ideally 72–78°F during the day and slightly cooler at night.
         They should never be exposed to temperatures above 82°F, as overheating can quickly become fatal.
         Unlike many reptiles, cresties do not require strong UVB lighting, but low-level UVB (2.0–5.0) has been shown to improve appetite, bone health, and day/night rhythm.
         Lighting should follow a natural cycle of 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness to regulate their internal clock.

      <h2>Common Health Issues</h2>
      <img src="../images/health.jpg" alt="Crested gecko health">
      <p>Crested geckos are hardy animals, but they can experience health issues if their environment or diet is incorrect.
         Stuck shed is common when humidity is too low and can cause difficulty with toes, tail tips, and skin folds;
         regular misting and hydration help prevent this. Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD) results from calcium deficiency and improper lighting or diet and leads to weak bones, shaking limbs, 
         and deformities—this is easily prevented with proper CGD diet and calcium supplementation.
         Dehydration can occur if humidity is too low or if the gecko does not drink regularly.
         Signs include wrinkled skin, lethargy, and stuck shed. Impaction is another risk when ingesting loose substrate, especially in young or small geckos, so careful substrate choice is important.
         Lastly, monitor for sudden weight loss, poor appetite, or unusual behavior, as these can indicate parasites or internal infections. When in doubt, a reptile veterinarian should be consulted.
