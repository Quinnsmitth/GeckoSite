      <h2>Bioactive vs Non-Bioactive Enclosures</h2>
      <p>
        Bioactive setups include live plants and a clean-up crew, creating a natural ecosystem.  
        Non-bioactive setups use simple substrates like paper towel or coconut fiber. Both are safe; choose based on your preferred maintenance level.

      <p>
        The primary diet is commercial CGD (Crested Gecko Diet). Live insects like crickets or dubia are optional but provide enrichment. Dust all insects with calcium + D3.
