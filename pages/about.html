      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <img src="../images/gecko.jpeg" alt="Crested Gecko">
      <p>
        We’re <strong>Quinn and Cameron</strong>, two reptile lovers who have been caring for 
        <strong>crested geckos for over 5 years</strong>. What started as a hobby quickly grew into a passion, 
        and over time we realized just how difficult it can be for new keepers to find reliable, consistent 
        care information.
      </p>
      <p>
        After seeing countless beginners receive confusing or incorrect advice online, we decided to 
        create a place where anyone can learn proper crested gecko care — clearly, simply, and confidently.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <img src="../images/morphs.jpg" alt="Gecko habitat">
      <p>
        Our goal is to make <strong>accurate, accessible, beginner-friendly information</strong> available to everyone.  
        Crested geckos are incredible animals, and they deserve the right environment, diet, and care to thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're caring for your first gecko or you already have an established collection, 
        we want to help you make the best choices for your animals. From feeding guides to enclosure 
        setups to supply recommendations — we aim to cover everything a modern keeper needs.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Only Crested Geckos?</h2>
      <img src="../images/moregecko.webp" alt="Crested gecko close-up">
      <p>
        We specialize exclusively in <strong>crested geckos</strong> because we believe in focusing on what we know best.  
        By dedicating our time to one species, we can provide deeper, more accurate, and more helpful guidance than 
        broad reptile websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crested geckos are unique — hardy, expressive, easy to handle, and perfect for keepers of all experience 
        levels. They've been part of our lives for years, and we’re excited to share that passion with you.
